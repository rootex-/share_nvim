INTRODUCTION                                                          *crates*

Crates is a plugin that helps managing crates.io dependencies.
It can display a crate's versions, features and dependencies, allows
updating/upgrading versions, enabling/disabling features and more.

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                           *crates-usage*

Basic setup.
>lua
    require('crates').setup()
<

Setup for plain text (without patched font).
>lua
    require('crates').setup {
        <SHARED:plain_text_config.lua>
    }
<

Setup with default options.

NOTE: The icons in the default config require a patched font, if you don't have
one use the plain text config.
For more information about individual config options see |crates-config|.
>lua
    require('crates').setup {
        <SHARED:DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION>
    }
<

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                                     *crates-mappings*

NOTE: Crates doesn't use any global key mappings by default.

But here are some recommended ones.
For more information about the lua function see |crates-functions|.
>lua
    <SHARED:keymaps.lua>
<

And here are the same ones in vimscript.
>vim
    <SHARED:keymaps.vim>
<

To integrate the crates popup in an idiomatic way into your configuration, you
might want to use one of the following snippets for contextual documentation.

NOTE: If you're using the in-process language server and |crates-config-lsp-hover|
is enabled, this isn't necessary.

How you might integrate `show_popup` into your `init.lua`.

FUNCTIONS                                                   *crates-functions*

All of these functions are members of the `crates` root module.
They can be accessed like this.
>lua
    require('crates').function_name()

COMMAND                                                       *crates-command*

:Crates {subcmd}

Run a crates.nvim {subcmd}. All {subcmd}s are just wrappers around the
corresponding |crates-functions|. These are the functions available as
commands:

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                                  *crates-config*

This section describes the configuration table which can be passed to
`crates.setup()`. The type of this table is available as an EmmyLua annotation
named `crates.UserConfig`.

NOTE: If a field is labeled `Section` it's a table of subfields and uses their
default values if not specified. This is different from other fields with
table types like `string[]`. Non `Section` fields will completely override the
default value, not extend them.

HIGHLIGHTS                                                 *crates-highlights*

This is a list of the default highlight groups used by crates.nvim. To change
them, you can either overwrite them or use different ones in
|crates-config-highlight| and |crates-config-popup-highlight|.
