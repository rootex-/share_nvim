* Several Tests
We use the subheadlines to keep the orgfile responsive. Because of some
performance bug not too much link should be visible at a time.
** Tests: Follow links to headings
 [[file:./subdir/subtest.org::*Heading Sub1][file:subtest -> *Heading Sub1]] -> should work
 [[./subdir/subtest.org::*Heading Sub1][./subtest -> *Heading Sub1]] -> should work
 [[/home/seflue/Nextcloud/Documents/test_org/subdir/subtest.org::*Heading Sub1][/full_path/subtest -> *Heading Sub1]] -> should work
 [[file:./subdir/subtest.org::*Redundant][file:subtest -> *Redundant]] -> should work and present selection
 [[file:./subdir/subtest.org::*Redundant][./subtest -> *Redundant]] -> should work and present selection
 [[file:./subdir2/subtest2.org::*Test][subtest -> *Test]] -> should work and present selection
 [[file:./subdir2/subtest2.org::*Test][subtest -> *Test]] -> should work and present selection
 [[*Subheading]] --> should jump within file
** Tests: Follow links to CUSTOM_IDs
 [[file:./subdir/subtest.org::#ID_Redundant][subtest -> #ID_Redundant]] -> should work and present selection
 [[file:./subdir2/subtest2.org::#ID_Test][subtest2 -> #ID_Test]] -> should work and present selection
 [[#ID_Subheading_root]] -> should jump within file
** Tests: Follow plain link
 [[dedicated anchor]] -> should jump to section with dedicated anchor
 [[test]]
** Tests: Omnicompletion
 [[file:./subdir/subtest.org::# -> autocompletion should work and filter correctly
 [[file:./subdir2/subtest2.org::# -> autocompletion should work and filter correctly
 [[file:./subdir/subtest.org::* -> autocompletion should work and filter correctly
 [[file:./subdir2/subtest2.org::* -> autocompletion should work and filter correctly
 [[. --> writing "." should not produce an error

** Tests: Misc
 [[https://github.com/nvim-orgmode/orgmode#nvim-orgmode][external: goto github]] -> should work
 [[][empty link]] -> should do nothing
 [[./../../../../README.md]]      --> should open foreign file
