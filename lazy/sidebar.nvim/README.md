## TODOs (Need help)

- [ ] Allow sections to define custom hl groups for icons
- [ ] See repo issues, any contribution is really appreciated
- [x] Better section icons - users can define custom icons see [Options](./doc/general.md#options)
- [x] Improve docs + write vim help files - thanks @aspeddro


## Third party sections

- [dap-sidebar.nvim](https://github.com/GustavoKatel/dap-sidebar.nvim) - Show Dap breakpoints in the sidebar

## Development

We are trying to limit the frequency of merges to the default branch, therefore less noise during plugin update and possible less bugs.

If you don't mind frequent updates and/or want to test new features, you might want to check the `dev` branch.

Before reporting a bug, please check if the bug still exists in the `dev` branch.
